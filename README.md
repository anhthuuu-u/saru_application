# Saru_application
This is our project of Mobile Commerce Development course.

We are Group 6 from class 243MI2702, University of Economics and Law, VNU-HCM.

Our team has built a Java-based mobile application for Android - SARU, is an online store specializing in wine and wine related products. Born amidst the majestic mountains and mystical mists of SaPa, SARU wine embodies the essence of upland rice and traditional distillation secrets, offering a warm and profound drinking experience. More than just a beverage, each drop of SARU is an invitation to explore the culture, people, and nature of SaPa, encapsulating the free spirit and memorable stories of the Northwest.

This is the Final-term Project for Mobile App Development by our team with 5 members in 3 months. Our project includes 4 part:
1. Backend
2. Database
3. Administrator website implementation
4. Client application implementation

Thank you for your attention.

## Backend

This folder contains the source code for the backend of the application, responsible for handling API requests, interacting with the database, and managing business logic.

### Folder Structure
-   `index.js`: This is the main application file for the backend, where API routes are defined, the database (MongoDB) connection is established, and the server is initialized.
-   `package.json`: This file contains metadata about the project (e.g., name, version, author) and lists all project dependencies.
-   `package-lock.json`: This file records the exact version of all dependencies and sub-dependencies used in the project, ensuring consistent installations across different environments.
-   `node_modules/`: This folder is automatically created when you install the project's dependencies (using `npm install`). It contains all the libraries and packages that your backend project needs to run.

## Database

This folder primarily contains project configuration files and does not directly house database schemas, data, or database management scripts. The files located here are mainly related to the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and version control.

### Folder Structure

-   `misc.xml`: This file typically stores various project-wide settings in IntelliJ IDEA, such as the project's language level, used SDK, and output directories.
-   `modules.xml`: This file defines the modules within your project and their paths to corresponding `.iml` files.
-   `vcs.xml`: This file contains configuration for the Version Control System (VCS) used in the project, such as Git settings.
-   `workspace.xml`: This file stores user-specific workspace settings, including window layouts, run/debug configurations, and history.
-   `database.iml`: (Not uploaded) This is an IntelliJ IDEA module file. It holds specific settings for the "database" module within your project, such as content roots, library dependencies, and source settings.
-   `test file.pub`: (Not uploaded) With a `.pub` extension, this could be a public key file, often used for encryption or authentication. Its precise purpose in this context would require more information.
